# Lab 3 - PWM Experiment 
## Introduction
A single PWM channel belonging to the Flextimer 0 (PTC10/FTM_CH12) is enabled to provide a PWM signal with a 500ms period. The signal's duty cycle increases its period every 100ms.

To visually observe the signal connect a led from (J4 connector, pin 10) to GND (J3, pin 14). Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).

## Dependencies
- NXP FRDM K64F development board
- Keil Studio Cloud IDE
- Solderless breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 3mm/5mm LED bulb
